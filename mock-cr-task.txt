For the first 20 minutes of the task, pretend as though
you are reviewing this code. Identify as many issues,
areas for improvement, confusing aspects, along with whatever you learn
WITHOUT modifying the code.

During the last 25 minutes, use what you learned in the first 20 minutes
to help you attempt to fix the problematic code you identified.
