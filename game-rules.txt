Snake:
You, the player, control a snake that eats food. 
Each food piece appears at a random coordinate in the game grid.
There should only be one food piece on the screen at a time.
Whenever the snake eats a piece of food, the snake grows, the player earns 50 points, and a new piece of food spawns in the grid.
The game is lost when the snake runs into the edge of the grid OR if the snake runs into itself.

Tetris:
You, the player, drop shapes comprised of 4 squares in various formations in a grid. These formations include:
- an L shape (3 squares stacked on top of one another with one square to the right of the bottom-most square), 
- a J shape (3 squares stacked on top of one another with one square to the left of the bottom-most square),
- a Z shape (2 squares on top and two squares on bottom, with the bottom squares translated to the right)
- an S shape (2 squares on top and two squares on bottom, with the bottom squares translated to the left)
- an I shape (4 squares stacked vertically)
- a T shape (3 squares on the top row, and 1 square on bottom in the middle)
- a square shape (4 squares that make a 2 by 2 large square)
Each piece falls row by row.
The shape can be rotated.
When a whole row of the grid is filled up with shapes, that row disappears and the player earns a point.
- Multiple rows can be removed when a shape hits the bottom of the grid and completes multiple rows.
If the shapes reach the top of the grid, the player loses.
